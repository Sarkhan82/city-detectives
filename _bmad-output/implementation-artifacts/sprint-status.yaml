# ===============

# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows (see epics.md Parallelization & Agent Lanes)
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)
